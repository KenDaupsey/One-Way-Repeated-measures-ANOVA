One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA

One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA is a powerful statistical technique used to analyze the effects of treatments or interventions over multiple time points or conditions on the same subjects. This README provides a concise guide to performing One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA in Python, using the example dataset "df1." 

 Overview
In this analysis, we explore how a factor "a" influences a dependent variable "y" measured repeatedly on the same subjects. The output from the analysis includes an F-value and p-value, indicating the significance of the observed differences. A small p-value suggests a meaningful impact, while a large p-value implies changes could be due to chance.

 Procedure
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from the weblink: [a Stata file using `pyreadstat` library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KenDaupsey/One-Way-Repeated-measures-ANOVA/main/Oneway%20Repeated%20Measures%20ANOVA%7Erb4.csv), and the structure is examined.
2. **One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA**: The `AnovaRM` function from `statsmodels.stats.anova` is used to conduct the analysis, specifying the dependent variable, subject, and within-subjects factor.
3. **Interpretation**: The output provides key statistics including F-value, degrees of freedom, and p-value, aiding in interpreting the significance of the factor "a."

 Funnel Chart
Funnel charts are often used to visualize mean values across different levels of a factor. Two implementations are provided using Matplotlib and Plotly libraries, offering options for creating engaging visualizations.

 Additional Visualizations
Further visualizations such as line plots can enhance the understanding of trends in mean values across different conditions or time points. An example of creating a repeated measures line plot using the seaborn library is included, offering insights into sequential changes in mean values.

By following this guide, researchers and analysts can effectively analyze repeated measures data, gaining valuable insights into the effects of interventions or treatments over time or under different conditions.
